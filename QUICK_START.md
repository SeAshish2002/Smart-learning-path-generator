## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### Application Not Starting?
1. Make sure ports 3000 and 5000 are not in use
2. Check that all dependencies are installed: `npm install` in root, server, and client folders
3. Verify `.env` files exist in both `server/` and `client/` folders

### Database Errors?
- The app uses SQLite by default (no setup needed!)
- Make sure `USE_SQLITE=true` is in `server/.env`

### Can't Register/Login?
- Check that the backend server is running on port 5000
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `.env` files are configured correctly
